# tweetViewer
Android Application to view a set of tweets based on a search word

This was done for my application to TribalScale

Credits to github user thest1 for developing the ImageLoader that I used to load images from a URL

Next Steps:
 - I'm not a great artist/designer so the UI could use some work in cleaning it up, colors, and fonts could be better
 - An animation or some feedback that data is being loaded/downloaded is an important feature that is missing.
 - A lacking feature is being able to change the number of items shown upon a search. (This could be done fairly quickly)
 - On the same note as the above point, being able to change the search parameters (by language, location etc) would be a good next step
 - If we incorporated Twitter Logins, we could feasibly let users tweet from this app too (essentially recreate the Twitter app)
 - Any additional information you would want to see in the "more details" section can be added in the code
